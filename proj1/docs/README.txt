Compiling and Running

Nothing but the execution of the scripts is required to compile our project.
To run simply run rmiregistry under the src/build/ folder and execute the desired scripts.

NOTE:
When executing the setup script, if the peer_id is 1, a folder named "originals" is created inside the "peerFiles" folder.
This folder is where files to be backed up should be placed.
If you wish to have other peers with an id different than 1 with original files, you should create "originals" folders accordingly.
